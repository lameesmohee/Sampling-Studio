## Project Description

A desktop application showcasing the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. Users can load, sample, and recover signals, observe the Nyquist rate effect, compose mixed signals, add noise with adjustable SNR, and enjoy real-time operations, all in a flexible and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- #### Signal Sampling & Recovery:
  Allows users to load, sample, and recover mid-length signals, emphasizing the importance of the Nyquist rate.
- #### Visual Representation:
  Provides three graphs to visualize the original signal, the reconstructed signal, and the difference between them.
- #### Load & Compose:
  Supports loading signals from files or composing signals by adding multiple sinusoidal components with different frequencies and magnitudes.
- #### Noise Addition:
  Enables users to introduce custom noise with controllable Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and illustrates its impact on different signal frequencies.
- #### Real-Time Processing:
  Performs sampling and recovery in real-time without the need for manual updates or refreshes. 
- #### Responsive UI:
  Allows the application to be resized without compromising the user interface.
